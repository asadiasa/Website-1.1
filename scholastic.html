  <h3>Scholastic Analytics Challenge</h3>
  <p>january 2020</p>
  <h4>Background</h4>
  <p>This project was a team submission to the Scholastic Analytics Challenge
  hosted by the Association of Information Systems. My team and I were on a tight
  deadline as we only had two weeks to work on this project.</p>
  <p>My team received a data set of two million records via a csv file. We cleaned, analyzed, and
  designed an infographic to report our findings. We were limited to submitting
  two pdf files, the infographic and a write up explaining our findings.</p>
  <h4>Tools</h4>
  <p> Python | Pandas Library | Tableau </p>
  <h4>Drafts</h4>

  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>When I started this project, I expected to be able to complete all the analysis on
    Excel and Tableau. Due to the size of the data set, I had no choice but to utilize
    Python. A lot of late nights were spent at the library in order to complete this
    project, but I do not regret my participation. This project ignited my passion for data analytics
    and allowed me to learn so much about perseverance along with the technical skills I gained.
    <br></br>
    Although my team did not place in the top 10, I am determined to tackle another analytics
    challenge in the near future with the new skills that I have gained through this project.
