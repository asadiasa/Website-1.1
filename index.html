      <h4>Hey There!</h4>
      <p id="publish-date">Published: May 25, 2020</p>
      <p class="hi-there"> During the last week of classes, I got a call that my internship was cancelled.
      As an avid planner, this put me into a slight panic mode because
      I suddenly had 14 weeks of nothing to do. So I decided to take matters
      into my own hands and take-on some personal projects. First up: let's build
      a website! Oh an just a disclaimer I only started learning HTML/CSS
      two weeks ago!</p>

      <h4>Still Here!</h4>
      <p id="publish-date">Published: Aug 6, 2020</p>
      <p class = "still-here">The day to day seemed to have slowly crawled on, but my summer break as
      a whole seemed to have flown by! I had a few things occupying my time but it was mostly
      a period of rest. Conciously carving out the time for rest and self-discovery is something
      that I have gotten to know these past 5 months. As a 20 year old, I am still trying to figure out
      who I am and my personal brand. This website has been through a handful of iterations as I explore
      web design and different tools. Most recently, I invested in an iPad and started using Procreate and
      PicsArt to play around with editing photos. As I continue my formal eduction, I hope to continue
      expressing my creativity through graphic design. No matter what you do, I am a strong believer that we all
      need an outlet for creativity!</p>
