      <h3>Scalawags Veterinary Database Project</h3>
      <p>fall 2019</p>
      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>Upon receiving this project in our database management
        class, my team and I established a high level of professionalism throughout
        this project. We named our team Elevate Enterprises and created a logo and a code of ethics
        within our team charter.<br></br>Our client, the Scalawags Veterinary Clinic, wished
        to upgrade on outdated system of recordkeeping. The client was currently using Excel and paper files to store their data,
      but it has become inefficient and created problems in terms of organization.
      Although the client is fictional, it is base off of an actual client and project that my professor has worked with.</p>
      <h4>Tools</h4>
      <p>SQL | Tableau | Microsoft Excel | Canva</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>This project allowed me to grow intellectually while working in a team setting.
      In the beginning, my team had our weekly scrum meetings in the morning before class. We soon realized
      that the arranement was not working for us so we made some adjustments. In order to accomodate our busy schedules, we
      transitioned to utilizing Google Hangouts. We also found that it was easier to collaborate in this setting because
     it allowed us to share our screens. <br></br> There were also about two milestones where my team and I faced heightened
    time pressures. We found a relational error within our table and had to make big adjustments days before the deadline. But despite all
    the long nights, my team and I bonded and encouraged each other throughout this project. I never could have completed this
    project without the effort that all my team members contributed.<br></br> Overall, this project really pushed me intellectually and mentally.
    I was able to learn so much about datbases in four months. I will definitely utilize everything that I learned!</p>
