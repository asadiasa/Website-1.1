      <h2>Passionate Programmer</h2>
      <p>I wrote my first line of code during my first semester of my
      freshman year of college. I landed in an honors information systems class just because it fit in my
      schedule. While most of my experience is in data analytics, I am passionate
      about web development as well!</p>

    <h2>Student Leader</h2>
    <p>I currently attend the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University.
    On campus, you can most likely find me at the Student Engagement Office where I work
    as a Navigator. I collaborate with staff and students to cultivate a sense of community among
    busiess students. In the evenings you can find
    me at a Department Information System Club (DISC) events participating in
    case competitions or educating the community about technology!</p>

    <h2>Proud Filipina-American</h2>
    <p>I moved to Arizona when I was ten years old from the Philippines. As a first
    generation American, I value hard work, compassion, and acceptance. After I moved to America,
    I desperately tried to hide my culture in order to fit in. As I grow up, I realized how
    important it is to honor my heritage because it gives me my identity. I am passionate about
    using tech for good by creating platforms for minority voices.</p>
