      <h2>Passionate Programmer</h2>
      <p>I wrote my first line of code during my first semester of my
      freshman year of college. I wasn't even actually supposed to be in the class.
      I landed in an honors information systems class just because it fit in my
      schedule. The whole semester was a whirl wind as I learned a sea of
      information covering the basics of everything from UX/UI, programming,
      databases, and so much more! I was constantly trying to catch my
      breath keeping up with the material. But I knew that I had to switch my
      major from economics to information systems when despite struggling
      with most of my assignments, I was so excited with everything I was learning.
      I've been learning new things about tech everyday and probably for the
      rest of my life!</p>

    <h2>Student Leader</h2>
    <p>I currently attend the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University.
    On campus, you can most likely find me at the Student Engagement Office where I work
    as a Navigator, working with staff and students to cultivate a community and carry
    on the mission of the school that "business is personal". In the evenings you can find
    me at a Department Information System Club (DISC) event ranging from analytics
    case competition or educating the community about technology!</p>

  <div class="culture">
    <h2>Proud Filipina-American</h2>
    <p>I moved to Arizona when I was ten years old from the Philippines. As a first
    generation American, I value hard work, compassion, and acceptance. After I moved to America,
   I desperately tried to hide my culture in order to fit in. As I grow up, I realized how
  important it is to honor my heritage because it gives me my identity. I am passionate about
 using tech for good by creating platforms for minority voices.</p>
